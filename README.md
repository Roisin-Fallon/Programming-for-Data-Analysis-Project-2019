## Introduction

Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook. This project can be broken into 3 distinct sections: 

1. <b><i>Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four diï¬€erent variables.</i></b> 
2. <b><i> Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.</i></b>
3. <b><i> Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible. </i></b>
